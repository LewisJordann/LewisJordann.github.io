                <h2 class="project-header"><a href="https://github.com/vynleran/senior-capstone-project">STRapp - Seizure Technical Responce Application</a></h2>
                <h3 class="technologies">Java | XML | Python | Arduino</h3>
                <p class="projectDesc">
                    Seizure Technical Response app, STRapp, is a user-friendly Android application that connects to a custom-built wristband via Bluetooth. 
                    It allows individuals with epilepsy and other seizure disorders to alert their emergency contacts automatically when a seizure has been detected based on data received from the wristband. 
                    The wristband currently includes three sensors, which are electrodermal activity (EDA), accelerometer, and heart rate. Seizure detection is implemented on a backend server that processes data recordings using data mining algorithms. 
                    Once a seizure has been detected, a help request is sent from the STRapp. Help requests can also be sent manually if immediate help is needed or if help might be needed soon. 
                    Also, if the duration of a seizure is longer than a user-determined time, then emergency services are automatically contacted. 
                    Seizures can also be recorded automatically or manually by the user. This allows the user to export this data and forward it to their medical professional. 
                    Moreover, the user can view their vitals in real-time. By knowing this information, the individual has the ability to verify their suspicions regarding a likely seizure. 
                    STRapp aims to provide peace of mind to individuals who suffer from seizure disorders.

                <h3 class="technologies">HTML | CSS | JavaScript | Flask</h3>
                <p class="projectDesc">
                    I am designing a website for families or groups of people to easliy set up their own secret santa for the holidays.
                    The event creator will be able to add people to the event along with their email or phone number. Once everyone is added to the event, the creator will
                    press a button and either an email or text message will be sent out to the participants on who they need to purchase a gift for. This project is current under development
                    and is expected to be finished by Christmas 2023!

                <h3 class="technologies">Python PANDAS</h3>
                <p class="projectDesc">
                    Apart of an advanced data mining class, my group was tasked with analysing an existing dataset and analysis on heart attack prediction from kaggle. 
                    Following the CRISP-DM, we verified that the original analysis was correct.
                    Then using LIME (Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations), we analyzed the 7 different models and determined which ones would make the most sense for detecting heart attacks based on the given dataset.
